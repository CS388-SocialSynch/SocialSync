## Overview

### Description

It is hard to schedule times to meet when you are a college student, everyone in the friends group has conflicting schedules. We are coming with an App where users can schedule time to meet by selecting the times they are available. Our app is a mobile version of the https://www.when2meet.com/ website, it also shows the weather information on the day of meeting.
