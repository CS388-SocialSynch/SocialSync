# Evaluating and Categorizing Top 3 Ideas

1. Math Problem Solver App
   - **Description:** An app allowing users to take pictures of math problems. It would process the image into text, solve it, and provide hints before answering, aiding users in solving difficult problems.
   - **Category:** Education & Productivity
   - **Mobile:** Mobile is required as we are utilizing the camera feature to allow people to hover over the problem, take a picture, and get an answer and response, they can use the app to track their previous pictures to attempt to solve it again later, also provides videos online of tutorials that can be helpful.
   - **Story:** Allows a user, whether it be a student, or a teacher who provides a resource for hints or help regarding problems, to help reinforce learning, show them how to do it, and help create a more streamlined and better experience for students to learn more, and teachers to help guide them.
   - **Market:** It will most likely be available to the public in general but it will mostly be students who would download the app to help them out or teachers and schools can get a district-wide version that gives them more hints or more thorough guides and videos that can be distributed to students to help them.
   - **Habit:** Students would use this app when necessary, and teachers can also use this app and maybe even have an account to track who is using the app more than others that could then use more dedicated time to help students struggling with the subject.
   - **Scope:** At first it would simply be the app can take pictures and have a way to translate that picture into readable text, with an option to allow a user to change the text if there are any errors. After that would be to incorporate the solver into the app and have the response be sent back and displayed to the user. The next step is incorporating the steps and guide process for the solution, and making the hint system. After that, it will be polishing and making an accounting system for both sides if a teacher or school wants to use this.
   
2. Journal App
   - **Description:** Send daily reminders for users to submit journal entries detailing their day. Allow users to incorporate pictures, stickers, drawings, and links to remember events.
   - **Category:** Lifestyle 
   - **Mobile:** The mobile version would allow a user to have an app and device to store their daily entries on the go, and with the efficient data storage, it is a lot smaller than a notebook for example, and since users often have a phone at ready, it would be more convenient than going to a website, and having the app store it locally, with the option of a cloud, makes it seamless if they were to go from device to device, or basic user experience with the app
   - **Story:** Allows a user to reflect upon themselves and what they did that day, to help establish perhaps progress on what they did, what they are working on to do any goals, or simply a way to jot their thoughts that they can look back on at a future date, which can help yourself show how you were doing or how far you've come, or others if you'd like to share your entries by showing it to them.
   - **Market:** Any user on the app store or play store can download our app to utilize it, we can offer bonus benefits, extra widgets, and features to help entice users to our app, and maybe have some miscellaneous items for monetization that can help give a journal entry some extra wow factor.
   - **Habit:** This app would notify users daily to submit a daily record for their journal, and it may pull some user data depending on where they went, pictures they took, etc, so in general they'd be creating entries for their own purposes.
   - **Scope:** First version would be to make a home screen and have it sort entries based on days, months, or even years with a button, then set up a notification system for every day if a user agrees to it, and start making entries for text only items in the meantime. The next version would be to incorporate allowing pictures, processing them, or to have widgets and items be able to be pasted to the entry. The next version would streamline the app, making better styling, and nicer text, and if the user agrees to when the notification is sent it would see if a user did anything new today, either pictures or places they went, as a suggestion that they'd like to write down
3. Mobile Version of When2Meet
   - **Description:** Develop a mobile version of When2Meet, currently available only on desktop. This would enable easier coordination for users who predominantly use mobile devices and incorporating a notification, chat, and event system would help many users coordinate on a date to meet, helping users work together better, without the unnecessary back and forth for deciding on a time
   - **Category:** Social
   - **Mobile:** A mobile version is essential in our day and age, as many prospecting users of this app would be students, whether primary education or higher education, employees at a company or their employer, or any self-employed or other individuals who'd like an easier way to coordinate with others, to help create a more streamlined process that will allow people to work together faster, making people more efficient and productive.
   - **Story:** This app can provide an invaluable tool for students, employees/employers, and more to allow for greater coordination with others to help boost productivity and allow a greater sense of cooperation, students can use this to work with other students on projects, employees to meet up for critical assignments, and others whether it be for an event or a family outing for example, all of this making people's lives easier to decide on a date without the back and forth.
   - **Market:** This app would most likely be targeted at students or employees/employers, but it will still have a broad market for the general population who would like a better way to coordinate with others, the potential size and scale can be in the millions if people see the benefit and use of our app in making their lives easier, and having this simple concept, a way for people to meet, when, and where, can be easily understood by our target audiences.
   - **Habit:** This app would not be habit forming but it could be used frequently when necessary to create, go to, and meet up for events or times by the user, and since the vast majority of people would be invited to an event for the meetup, while the rest would create the events, it will mostly be a majority-consuming app for the event that is created.
   - **Scope:** Initial setup would be to allow a user to sign up with an email, whether through Google authentication or a new email registered to the app, allow said user to create an event, and assign it to the database. The next step would be to allow this event to be shared and to allow other users to update this event with their preferred time and date. The next version would be to incorporate the weather availability to allow users to see what is the weather like at the time and date they selected, and incorporate a Google Maps API too to let people select a preferred spot. The next version is to display the event, and the overlapping times in a user-friendly format to show what users selected and what other users also did. After that would be some polishing and UI/UX design to make it appealing to the eye.
